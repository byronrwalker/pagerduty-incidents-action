- **Incident Response Tracking**: Integrate into your team's workflow to automatically track and log incidents for future review.

## Setup Instructions
1. PagerDuty API Token:

 - Create a PagerDuty API token with the `read` permission in the PagerDuty dashboard.
 - Store the token as a secret in your GitHub repository by going to Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions > New repository secret and adding `PAGERDUTY_TOKEN` as the secret name.

2. Schedule ID:

 - Find the schedule ID of the PagerDuty schedule you want to track by visiting the schedule in PagerDuty and extracting the ID from the URL (e.g., `https://<subdomain>.pagerduty.com/schedules/P0AWF24` where `P0AWF24` is the schedule ID).

## Development
